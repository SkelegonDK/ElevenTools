# ElevenTools Design Document

## Overview
ElevenTools is a comprehensive interface for ElevenLabs' text-to-speech API, designed to streamline the process of generating high-quality voice content. It provides both single and bulk generation capabilities, with advanced features for customization and reproducibility.

## Core Principles
1. User-Friendly: Intuitive interface for both novice and experienced users.
2. Flexibility: Support for various use cases, from single audio clips to large-scale batch processing.
3. Reproducibility: Emphasis on seed management for consistent results.
4. Extensibility: Modular design to easily incorporate new features and integrations.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- Streamlit-based web application
- Multi-page structure: Main page for single generation, separate page for bulk processing
- Responsive design with sidebar for global settings

### Backend
- Python-based core logic
- Modular function structure for easy maintenance and extension
- API integration with ElevenLabs and OpenAI

### Data Flow
1. User input (text, settings) → 
2. Processing (variable replacement, phonetic conversion) → 
3. API requests (ElevenLabs for TTS, OpenAI for phonetics) → 
4. Audio generation → 
5. Result presentation and storage

## Key Components

1. Voice and Model Selection
   - Dynamic fetching of available voices and models from ElevenLabs API
   - Caching mechanism to reduce API calls

2. Text Processing
   - Variable replacement system for personalized content
   - Integration with OpenAI for phonetic conversions

3. Audio Generation
   - Single generation with immediate playback
   - Bulk generation from CSV files
   - Seed management for reproducibility

4. Settings Management
   - Voice settings (stability, similarity, style, speaker boost)
   - Global settings stored in session state for consistency across pages

5. Bulk Processing
   - CSV parsing and processing
   - Parallel generation of multiple audio files
   - Result aggregation and presentation

## Feature Details

1. Single Audio Generation
   - Text input with variable support
   - Real-time variable replacement
   - Phonetic conversion option
   - Immediate audio playback

2. Bulk Audio Generation
   - CSV file upload for batch processing
   - Support for text variables in CSV
   - Option for random or fixed seed across batch
   - Bulk playback and optional download of generated audio

3. Seed Management
   - Random seed generation
   - Fixed seed option for reproducibility
   - Seed logging for each generated audio

4. Voice Customization
   - Adjustable parameters: stability, similarity, style
   - Speaker boost option

5. Model Selection
   - Support for multiple ElevenLabs models
   - Dynamic model list updating

## Technical Considerations

1. API Management
   - Secure handling of API keys
   - Rate limiting and error handling for API requests

2. Performance Optimization
   - Caching of frequently used data (models, voices)
   - Efficient handling of large CSV files for bulk processing

3. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error checking and user-friendly error messages
   - Logging for debugging and issue tracking

4. Scalability
   - Design considerations for handling increased load and larger datasets

## Future Vision

1. Enhanced AI Integration
   - Deeper integration with language models for content generation and enhancement
   - Exploration of voice cloning and custom voice creation

2. Advanced Audio Manipulation
   - Post-processing options for generated audio
   - Support for background music and sound effects

3. Collaborative Features
   - Multi-user support with role-based access
   - Shared project spaces for team collaboration

4. Analytics and Insights
   - Usage statistics and performance metrics
   - AI-driven suggestions for optimal voice and settings selection

5. Expanded Platform Support
   - Mobile app development
   - API endpoints for integration with other services

## Conclusion
ElevenTools aims to be the go-to solution for professional-grade text-to-speech generation, offering a perfect balance of simplicity and advanced features.
