## Why

Currently, all generated files are stored in a shared `outputs/` directory, which means:
- Users can see files generated by other users in cloud deployments
- No privacy isolation between sessions
- No download functionality - users must rely on ephemeral file system
- No cleanup mechanism for old files
- Files are lost on container restart in Streamlit Cloud

This creates privacy and usability issues, especially in multi-user cloud deployments.

## What Changes

- **Session-based file isolation** - Store files in session-specific directories (`outputs/{session_id}/`)
- **Download functionality** - Add download buttons for individual files and bulk ZIP downloads
- **Automatic cleanup** - Remove old session directories after configurable timeout (default: 24 hours)
- **Session-aware file explorer** - Only display files from current user's session
- **Session ID generation** - Create unique session identifiers for file organization

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: File management (modified), TTS generation (modified), Bulk generation (modified)
- **Affected code**:
  - `app.py` - Session-based output paths, download buttons
  - `pages/Bulk_Generation.py` - Session-based bulk output paths
  - `pages/File_Explorer.py` - Session filtering, download functionality
  - `scripts/Elevenlabs_functions.py` - Session-aware path handling
  - `utils/` - New session management utilities
- **Breaking changes**: None - existing files will be migrated or cleaned up
