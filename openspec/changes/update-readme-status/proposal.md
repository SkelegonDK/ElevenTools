## Why
The README.md file is outdated and does not reflect the current state of the project. It contains outdated version information, missing features (OpenRouter model selection with fuzzy search), incomplete testing documentation (missing Playwright UI tests), and an outdated TODO list with many completed items still marked as pending. Updating the README will provide accurate information to users and contributors.

## What Changes
- Update version number from 0.1.0 to 0.3.0 to match pyproject.toml
- Add OpenRouter model selection feature with fuzzy search and free model filtering to Features section
- Update Testing section to include Playwright UI tests and comprehensive test coverage details
- Update TODO list to reflect completed items and remove outdated entries
- Remove or update references to `docs/` folder (todo.md, design.md, architecture.md) - these are now superseded by OpenSpec for task management and spec-driven development
- Add OpenRouter API key requirement to Configuration section
- Update test file references to match actual test structure
- Add information about translation page model selection capabilities

## Impact
- Affected specs: None (documentation update only)
- Affected code: `README.md` (documentation file)
- User impact: Better documentation accuracy for users and contributors
