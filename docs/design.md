3. Reproducibility: Emphasis on seed management for consistent results.
4. Extensibility: Modular design to easily incorporate new features and integrations.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- Streamlit-based web application with multi-page structure:
  * Main page (app.py): Advanced text-to-speech interface
  * Voice Design page: Voice creation and customization
  * Bulk Generation page: Batch processing of audio files
  * Translation page: Script translation capabilities
- Responsive design with sidebar for global settings
- Session state management for consistent user experience

### Backend
