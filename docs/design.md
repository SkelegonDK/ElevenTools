## File Explorer for Generated Audio

To improve usability and transparency, ElevenTools provides a built-in File Explorer for all generated audio files:

- **Output Organization:**
  - All generated audio (single and bulk) is consolidated in a single `outputs` folder.
  - **Bulk outputs** are grouped by the source CSV file used for generation. Each group is named after the CSV file.
  - **Single outputs** are stored in a separate folder within `outputs`, with filenames in the format `LANGUAGE_VOICE_NAME_DATE_ID_SEED` for easy identification.

- **File Explorer UI:**
  - Accessible from within the app, allowing users to browse, review, and manage all generated audio files.
  - **Bulk outputs** are displayed inside Streamlit expanders, each expander labeled with the CSV file name. Inside each expander, audio files are shown as rows with audio players and metadata (language, voice, date, ID, seed, source CSV).
  - **Single outputs** are displayed as stacked rows (no expanders), each row showing an audio player and all relevant metadata.
  - All generation details are visible for each file, supporting transparency and reproducibility.
  - The UI is designed to be intuitive and responsive, supporting both novice and advanced users.

## Conclusion
ElevenTools aims to be the go-to solution for professional-grade text-to-speech generation, offering a perfect balance of simplicity and advanced features. By continually evolving based on user feedback and technological advancements, ElevenTools strives to remain at the forefront of voice synthesis technology.
